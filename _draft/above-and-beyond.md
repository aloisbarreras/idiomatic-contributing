> "Nothing fails like success" - Arnold Toynbee

Oftentimes, projects become more demanding as they grow in popularity. The volume of bug reports and feature requests goes up.

**Be nice**

- avoid criticizing and bashing
- avoid voicing frustration ("arg! this sucks!", and "...sigh, 3 hours later I figured this out!"). No one wants to hear these things.

Negative comments are insulting and disheartening to maintainers and other contributors who may have spent hundreds or thousands of hours on the project.
